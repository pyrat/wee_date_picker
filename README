WeeDatePicker
=============

This is a super simple datepicker for your rails apps. It is essentially just a packaged version of DatePicker v2.9 by frequency-decoder.com with rails helpers for easy integration.


Install
=======

Currently the contents of the files directory should be copied manually to your public directory. I would like to write a rake task to do this for me. Please do this and submit a patch if you have time.

Example
=======

In the *head* section of the layout.

<%= yield :date_includes %>

In the template.

<%= load_date_picker %>

Then for each date field you need to do the following. *Remember*: field_names have to be unique on your page.

<%= date_picker :start_date, Date.today %>

Where the first argument is the field_name and the second is the initial value. This must be a date object.
